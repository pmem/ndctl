NAME
----
libcxl - A library to interact with CXL devices through sysfs(5)
and ioctl(2) interfaces

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
#include <cxl/libcxl.h>
cc ... -lcxl

DESCRIPTION
-----------
libcxl provides interfaces to interact with CXL devices in Linux, using sysfs
interfaces for most kernel interactions, and the ioctl() interface for command
submission.

The starting point for all library interfaces is a 'cxl_ctx' object, returned
by linklibcxl:cxl_new[3]. CXL 'Type 3' memory devices are children of the
cxl_ctx object, and can be iterated through using an iterator API.

Library level interfaces that are agnostic to any device, or a specific
subclass of operations have the prefix 'cxl_'

The object representing a CXL Type 3 device is 'cxl_memdev'. Library interfaces
related to these devices have the prefix 'cxl_memdev_'. These interfaces are
mostly associated with sysfs interactions (unless otherwise noted in their
respective documentation pages). They are typically used to retrieve data
published by the kernel, or to send data or trigger kernel operations for a
given device.

A 'cxl_cmd' is a reference counted object which is used to perform 'Mailbox'
commands as described in the CXL Specification. A 'cxl_cmd' object is tied to a
'cxl_memdev'. Associated library interfaces have the prefix 'cxl_cmd_'. Within
this sub-class of interfaces, there are:

 * 'cxl_cmd_new_*' interfaces that allocate a new cxl_cmd object for a given
   command type.

 * 'cxl_cmd_submit' which submits the command via ioctl()

 * 'cxl_cmd_<name>_get_<field>' interfaces that get specific fields out of the
   command response

 * 'cxl_cmd_get_*' interfaces to get general command related information.
