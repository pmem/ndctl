NAME
----
ndctl-monitor - Monitor the smart events of nvdimm objects

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ndctl monitor' [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Ndctl monitor is used for monitoring the smart events of nvdimm
objects and dumping the json format notifications to syslog, standard
output or a logfile.

The objects to monitor and smart events to notify can be selected by
setting options and/or the default configuration file
(/etc/ndctl/monitor.conf). Both of the values in configuration file
and in options will work. If there is a conflict, the values in
options will override the values in configuration file. The changed
values in configuration file will work after the monitor is restarted.

EXAMPLES
--------

Run a monitor as a daemon to monitor DIMMs on bus "nfit_test.1"
[verse]
ndctl monitor --bus=nfit_test.1 --daemon

Run a monitor as a one-shot command and output the notifications to
/var/log/ndctl.log
[verse]
ndctl monitor --log=/var/log/ndctl.log

Run a monitor daemon as a system service
[verse]
systemctl start ndctl-monitor.service

	the system, optionally filtered by bus id (see --bus= option).

-n::
--namespace=::
	A 'namespaceX.Y' device name, or namespace region plus id tuple
	'X.Y'.

-l <file | syslog | standard>::
--log=<file | syslog | standard>::
	Output notifications to <file>, syslog or standard output.

-c::
--config-file=::
	Provide the config file to use. This overrides the default config
	typically found in /etc/ndctl/

--daemon::
	Run a monitor as a daemon.

-D::
--dimm-event=::
	Name of an smart health event from the following:
	- "dimm-spares-remaining": Spare Blocks Remaining value has gone
	   below the pre-programmed threshold.
	- "dimm-media-temperature": NVDIMM Media temperature value has
	   gone above the pre-programmed threshold.
	- "dimm-controller-temperature": NVDIMM Controller temperature
	   value has gone above the pre-programmed threshold.
	- "dimm-health-state": NVDIMM Normal Health Status has changed
	- "dimm-unclean-shutdown": NVDIMM Last Shutdown Status was a
	   unclean shutdown.
