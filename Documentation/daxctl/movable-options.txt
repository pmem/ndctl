--no-movable::
	'--movable' is the default. This can be overridden to online new
	memory such that it is not 'movable'. This allows any allocation
	to potentially be served from this memory. This may preclude subsequent
	removal. With the '--movable' behavior (which is default), kernel
	allocations will not consider this memory, and it will be reserved
	for application use.
